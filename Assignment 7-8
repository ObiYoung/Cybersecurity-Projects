Exploiting WordPress Website

Listed below are my exploitations I have conducted on my personal WordPress website lab environment.

1. Cross Site Scripting Exploit #1

On the home page, we can access the comments for the website and choose to leave our own comment. 
I tried a couple of XSS lines but the only XSS line of code that seemed to work was when I entered <IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>.
I hit submit and when it was loading a new page my alert that said "XSS" popped on the top of the screen.
